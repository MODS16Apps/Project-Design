CHANGES: There were very few resources from the previous MODSApps team for the Project Design team to work from, so the 
majority of the work has been made from scratch. Despite this lack of previous resources, the current app is heavily based
on the code samples from both the Android website and from the Android textbook samples being used in class. 

As is, the current version of our app utilizes a sample from the android code samples available directly from android studio. 
So far, the team has decided the layout (tabLayout) of the explorer app and the theme for design purposes. The current app lacks content, 
but the framework has already been established.

* Tab layout framework established
* Icon launchers replaced with MODS logo
* Theme swatches have been decided, although they have yet to be implemented
* Activity fragments have been established, and as content is made, these fragments will be modified accordingly.

TODO: 
* Add text based content (Intro paragraphs, credits, etc).
* Use intents to establish the framework so that individual exhibit apps can be incorporated into the main app.
* Complete the color theme changes (to MODS colors).
* Incorporate the interactive map from the previous MODSExplorer App
* Incorporate the analytics/database requirements discussed by Santiago
* Incorporate the live twitter feed, or, if time does not permit, delete the concept from the current app.
* Add the icons from the design teams of each exhibit.
* **It's possible that the majority of the work will be shifted from this code sample to one of the code samples in the book, as it seems to be easier to work with**

RUNDOWN:
* Andres: Identifying usable code samples to implement into the main, will be responsible for coding the intents/broadcast intents and the interactions with the database.
* Kianie: Designig the UI (i.e.: Modifying the theme to match MODS, implementing the logos, making the application look presentable).
